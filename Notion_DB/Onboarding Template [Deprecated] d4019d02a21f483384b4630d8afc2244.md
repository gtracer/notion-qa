    ## Knowledge Test
    
    1. Do clients manage their own timelines?
    2. Why is it important to manage timelines?
    3. What are you main levers for managing timelines?
    4. Who is better to extend a timeline with? Hiring Manager or Recruiter? Why?
    5. When extending a deadline, if a client already tried with a recruiter, can you try again with a hiring manager?
    6. If a client was equally interested in going to Google and Facebook but they had an offer from Facebook and were still interviewing with Google. 
        1. What are your options?
        2. What would you advise the client to do?
        - Answers
            1. Negotiate Facebook early on; delay FB and expedite Google
            2. We can try either but Google is so slow that you might not be able to fully execute the second. If you like the team at Facebook a lot, I would just do that
    7. A client has an Amazon offer with a deadline tomorrow (i.e. Amazon expects a call tomorrow). They did a first call with a recruiter at Facebook - your negotiation strategy is unconfirmed competing opportunity. Think through the strategy and then detail all of the headlines of the micro steps you need to take (e.g. setup call with Facebook recruiter, create script). *Steps should be in chronological order. My answer has 11 steps

            1. Step 1: Check if client is comfortable anchoring via email

            5. Step 5: Write anchor script 
            6. Step 6: Mock client on anchor 
            7. Step 7: Co-call Facebook anchor (maybe)
            8. Step 8: If FB doesnâ€™t respond, anchor via email or change to expecting strategy 
            9. Step 9: Counter Amazon script 
            10. Step 10: Mock client
